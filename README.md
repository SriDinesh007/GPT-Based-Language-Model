# GPT-Based-Language-Model

This repository contains the code implementation of a GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) based language model. The model is trained to generate text based on input sequences, making it capable of generating coherent and contextually relevant text.

## Project Structure

The repository includes the following files:

- **GPT-Based-language-model.py**: This Python script contains the implementation of the GPT model, including data preprocessing, model architecture, training loop, and text generation functionality.

- **input.txt**: This file contains the input text data used for training the language model. The model learns to generate text based on the patterns and structures present in this data.

- **GPT-Based language model.pdf**: This document provides detailed information about the architecture, training process, and usage of the GPT-based language model.

## Usage

To use the GPT-based language model:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and PyTorch installed.
3. Run the `GPT-Based-language-model.py` script to train the model or generate text.

## Training

To train the model:

1. Load the input text data from `input.txt`.
2. Preprocess the data by encoding characters to numerical values.
3. Define the GPT model architecture, including self-attention mechanisms and feed-forward layers.
4. Train the model using the provided training loop, optimizing the parameters using the AdamW optimizer.

## Text Generation

The trained GPT model can generate text based on given input sequences. You can specify the length of the generated text and the initial context to start the generation process.
